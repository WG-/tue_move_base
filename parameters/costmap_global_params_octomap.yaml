  # Costmap_2d takes a occupancy grid and transforms it to a costmap
  #
  # Occupancy grid: each cell represents the probability of occupancy.
  # Probabilities are in the range [0,100].  Unknown is -1.
  #
  # Costmap_2d: each cell has a cost
  # NO_INFORMATION = 255
  # LETHAL_OBSTACLE = 254
  # INFLATED_OBSTACLE = 253
  # FREE_SPACE = 0
  #
  # Costmap_2d sets the unknown cells from the occupancy grid to 255 as 
  # it only takes unsigned values. Only if the unknown_cost_value == 255 
  # and track_unknown_space is true the unknown values will be mapped to 
  # the NO_INFORMATION (255) cost.
  # HOWEVER: the cost will be overwritten in costmap_2d by the cost for
  # a LETHAL_OBSTACLE as all costs >= 100 are set to LETHAL_OBSTACLE
  # Bottom line: you can't distinghuish unknown space from obstacles!
